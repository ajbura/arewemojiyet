# Are we emoji yet?

Custom emojis have been an open issue on Element [since 2016](https://github.com/vector-im/element-web/issues/2648) and [MSC1951](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1951) is still open. While we wait, some clients have implemented an early version of custom emojis.

To use custom emojis, you need to use a compatible client. Here you can see compatible clients:
